          As put by google's dictionary "a system of words, letters, figures, or other
          symbols substituted for other words, letters, etc., especially for the
          purposes of secrecy." Its how we talk to and tell our computers what to do.
          Its everywhere from our computers, cellphones, to almost everything new like
          TVs, washing machines, vending machines and even elevators! It gives us power,
          and we like it... actually love it. We might not understand everything sometimes,
          but we like the power.
          If computers are the canvas, then code is the art. Code is how we make all sort
          of beautiful and or amazing things. Thats exactly what dragged me into learning
          code, and probably many other coders that are starting or have been coding for a
          while now.
